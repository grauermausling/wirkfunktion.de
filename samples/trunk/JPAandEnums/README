The sample project JPAandEnums demonstrates how to use Enums with custom
toString() in JPA Entitys without defining something like a custom UserType.

All source files are licensed under GPLv3.

To run the project use ant (with target TestLauncher):

> ant TestLauchner

.classpath and .project for eclipse included.

Have fun
