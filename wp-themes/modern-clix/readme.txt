MODERN CLIX 1.1
---------------

Thanks for downloading! Modern Clix is a minimal blog theme inspired in the Swiss Style of Design: It features Arial/Helvetica, grids, a generous use of whitespace for better readability and a strong focus in typography.

Modern Clix is WordPress 2.7 ready, and it will work in older versions too.

This theme is released under a GNU General Public License (GPL), version 3 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)

How to install
--------------

Copy the theme folder 'modern-clix' in wp-content/themes/. Activate it under Appearance > Themes (Wordpress 2.7) or Presentation > Themes (older versions of Wordpress) and you are ready to go.

To change the default tagline, edit the file 'header.php' (line 29). It will be displayed in the header. The tagline that you entered in the Wordpress admin will be displayed in the sidebar by default.

Flickr & Twitter compatibility
------------------------------

By default, the theme is shipped with my Flickr & Twitter accounts.

* Twitter: In 'footer.php', replace rodrigogalindez.json (line 12) with yourusername.json. Also, don't forget to point to your own Twitter URL in 'js/blogger.js' (line 7) 

* Flickr: In 'sidebar.php' replace user=27741269%40N00 (line 24) with your unique string. You can generate this string by loading this page: http://www.flickr.com/badge.gne and generating a simple HTML badge. In the last step, where the source code is generated, copy the string where it says "user=" and replace with the shipped one.

Type goodies
------------

Modern Clix is packed with special classes for nice type ornaments. Here are some ready-to-paste HTML snippets for instant type gratification:

* Nice ampersands: <span class="amp">&amp;</span>
* By-lines: <span class="low">by</span>
* All caps: <span class="ver">Sample text</span>
* Descriptions for images: <small class="tooltip"><em>Sample description.</em></small>

Images
------

To support full width images (up to 596px) use the class 'full-image' in the post. Example:

<div class="full-image">
    <img src="modern-clix.jpg" alt="Modern Clix" />
</div>

Full width images give each post a look of _breaking the grid_ that's pretty cool. 

Release notes and known bugs
----------------------------

Modern Clix is based in the Progressive Enhancement principle; this means that the theme will work perfectly and as desired in cool browsers (Safari, Firefox, Opera, IE 7), and will work limited in old or buggy browsers (IE6, IE5).

There are plans to make it work nicely in older browsers in the near future. For now, the known bugs are:

* Full width images are non supported. They are cropped in IE 6.
